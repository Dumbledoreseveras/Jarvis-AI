**Bala Kanda (Youth Episode)**:

Rama meets the monkey king Sugriva and his brother Vali. Rama helps Sugriva defeat Vali and becomes friends with Sugriva.

Asish Jana : Give me full speech.
Jarvis : Here is the full speech of Swami Vivekananda at the World's Parliament of Religions, Chicago, September 11, 1893:
"Sisters and Brothers of America,
It fills my heart with joy unspeakable to rise in response to the warm and cordial welcome which you have given us. I thank you in the name of the most ancient order of monks in the world, the order of the Sanyasins, who have been preaching the gospel of universalism for the last three thousand years, I thank you in the name of the sages of India, whose writings have been a source of inspiration to the learned of all lands, I thank you in the name of the ten million people of the Indian Empire who trust in God, and in the innate goodness of man.
I am proud to belong to a religion which has taught the world both tolerance and universal acceptance. We believe not only in universal toleration, but we accept all religions as true. I am proud to belong to a nation which has sheltered the persecuted and the refugees of all religions and all nations of the earth.
I will quote to you, brethren, a few lines from a hymn which I remember to have repeated from my earliest childhood, which is every day repeated by millions of human beings around us:
'As the different streams originating from different places, having their sources in different mountains, ultimately turn to the ocean, so also, O Lord, the different paths which people take, through different tendencies, various though they appear, crooked or straight, all lead to Thee.'
I papers I have in my hand are those of the sages of my own country, which have been written centuries ago, and they declare:
'Whosoever comes to me, though whatsoever form, I reach him; all men, in whatever direction they may move, in the end come to me.'
Sectarianism, bigotry, and its horrible descendant, fanaticism, have long possessed this beautiful earth. They have filled the earth with violence, drenched it often with human gore, destroyed civilization, and sent whole nations to despair. Had it not been for these horrible demons, human society would have been far more advanced than it is now. But their reign is not to last for ever. The time is already come when the voice of reform is heard, and the cry of the masses is rising, and the mighty winds of liberty are blowing, and the spirit of the age is awakening, and the voice of the sages of the past is being heard, and the soul of humanity is being stirred, and the masses are rising, and the end of the reign of sectionalism, and the dawn of the universal religion is at hand.
We believe in order to advance, we must be willing to be.advance. We must be willing to be criticized. We must be willing to criticize ourselves. We must be willing to be criticized by others. We must be willing to criticize others. But we must all criticize with the motive of helping each other, of helping the world.
And I may venture to say that the day is not far off when the whole of humanity will be united, when the voice of the sages of the past will be heard, when the cry of the masses will be answered, when the spirit of the age will be awakened, when the soul of humanity will be stirred, when the masses will rise, and when the universal religion will be established, and when the whole of humanity will be united in the bonds of brotherhood and love.
In conclusion, I take this opportunity to express my deepest gratitude to you for your kind attention, and to thank you for the indulgence you have shown to me. I take this opportunity also to express my deepest love and respect for all the religions of the world, and I make this fervent prayer to the Almighty, that He may bless each and every one of us, and make us all true instruments of His divine will, and make us all, and make us all true brothers and sisters, and may He make us all, and may He make us all, and may He make us all one, and may He make us all one.
Thank you."
I hope this helps, Sir!

Jarvis : **Continuation of Speech**
"I paper I have in my hand is from the latest philosophical school of India, and it is a comment on the Mundaka Upanishad. And it reads:
'Whosoever comes to me, though whatsoever form, I reach him; all men, in whatever direction they may move, in the end come to me.'
Sectarianism, bigotry, and its horrible descendant, fanaticism, have long possessed this beautiful earth. They have filled the earth with violence, drenched it often with human gore, destroyed civilization, and sent whole nations to despair. Had it not been for these horrible demons, human society would have been far more advanced than it is now. But their reign is not to last for ever. The time is already come when the voice of reform is heard, and the cry of the masses is rising, and the mighty winds of liberty are blowing, and the spirit of the age is awakening, and the soul of humanity is being stirred, and the masses are rising, and the end of the reign of sectionalism, and the dawn of the universal religion is at hand.
We believe in order to advance, we must be willing to be.advance. We must be willing to be criticized. We must be willing to criticize ourselves. We must be willing to criticize others. But we must all criticize with the motive of helping each other, of helping the world.
And I may venture to say that the day is not far off when the whole of humanity will be united, when the voice of the sages of the past will be heard, when the cry of the masses will be answered, when the spirit of the age will be awakened, when the soul of humanity will be stirred, when the masses will rise, and when the universal religion will be established, and when the whole of humanity will be united in the bonds of brotherhood and love.
In conclusion, I take this opportunity to express my deepest gratitude to you for your kind attention, and to thank you for the indulgence you have shown to me. I take this opportunity also to express my deepest love and respect for all the religions of the world, and I make this fervent prayer to the Almighty, that He may bless each and every one of us, and make us all true instruments of His divine will, and make us all, and make us all true brothers and sisters, and may He make us all, and may He make us all one, and may He make us all one.
Thank you."
